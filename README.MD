The following project is currently going through development as a way to speed up the classification of classified documents. The current model is simple as there is not enough data for the model to accurately predict between several different labels. This is because I am also responsible for labeling the data myself. Once more pages have been labeled, the model will be trained again and the process will repeat until the model can accurately do it's job.

- We have now gotten to the point where the model is pretty accurate. Now I will start to add in other labels to see if I can retain this accuracy.
